# Mafia Game

A game which assigns random roles to 6 players with 1 player being an imposter called the mafia. The mafia slowly kills the other players throughout the game. If the players manage the find and kill the mafia they win, however if the mafia kills a significant number of the others, the mafia wins.

# How to open

Prior to running program you must have unix terminal, git and python installed.

In the terminal enter:
```
cd desktop
git clone https://github.com/Harjot66/mafia_game.git
python3 mafia_game
```

# How to play

Please select one person as the moderator and allow only them to input commands into the terminal. There will be a screen showing all players and their randomly assigned roles, therefore please ensure the screen is not pointed towards any of the players. Seceretly whisper to or text each player their roles. Each round ask all players to close their eyes, and then one-by-one, ask each player with the assigned role on screen to open their eyes to answer, to which the moderator will silently give a response. At the end of each round, announce which players are still alive. Everyone has a discussion on who they think the mafia is and then votes in the town meetings for who they collective town would like to kill. Players who have been killed must stay silent and cannot influence the game afterwards. Have fun!
